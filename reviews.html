  breathtaking with amazing pictures we clicked...We even take part in some activities like Paragliding, Zorbing and 
  many... what the place offers us...We had a great taste of Manali....The weather was lovely and chilly in the evenings.
  Manali has lots to offer like paragliding, skiing, rafting. A visit to Rohtang Pass is a must . 
  It is closed for some time so one must check. Lovely place, lots of small restaurents and a vast variety of food. 
  The only hill station in India with the maximum number of hotels.

 <b><mark>ASSAM</mark></u></i></em></b><br>
  <i><b>good trip....Best beaches with full of cleanliness....Hotel rents are available at wide range...Assam state museum is nice place 
   to see the culture and history of Assam state. It opens at 10AM till 5PM. Around 2 hours is required to see the 
   entire place. Due to time crunch we unable to see everything. Good to visit....Had taken this trip from Avani and 
   had a good time. The driver was knowledgeable and friends and showed us all the destinations. Had a good time and 
   definitely recommend the tour...We had a great experience during our week long trip through Arunachal Pradesh with 
   Grand Eastern! Our driver was obviously very experienced and well equipt to handle the wary road conditions. 
   Got us everywhere we needed to go in a safe & timely manner! They made wonderful suggestions about homestays and 
   activities. I would love to take their services again and would definitely recommend.....Mandal Gang at Bhalukpong,
  which was pretty average in terms of service and cleanliness...A special mention to Mr Raktim as he would regularly 
  check on us during the trip and would immediately address any of the concerns or issues we faced during the trip...
  All in all, it was one of the most memorable trips we had and would definetly recommend them for experiencing a true 
  glimpse of the north east

  <b><u><mark>VARANASI</mark></u></i></em></b><br><br>
  <i><b>good trip....Great views, great experience, sadhus, arti ceremony, hawkers, temples, cremation at Manikarnika ghat,
   palaces, havelis etc all were mind boggling. Everything was much more nice than we had expected. Will definitely visit
   again..Its impossible to think of varanasi as just another pilgrimage place . It is lined with ghats - the best way to 
   appreciate the ghats is to take a boatride either early morning or in the evening during sunset and arti time when it 
   is beutifully lit . Each ghat is unique in its buidings , history and character...This is a 'must see'. The colour and
   atmosphere have to be experienced to be believed. Whether you walk the pathways or take a boat ride you will not be disappointed.
   It is incredibly safe to mingle with the crowds and watch the street sellers at work....A lot can be said about the 
   Assi Ghat, but those will only be words. Its a must visit place.Their is so much of solitude at the Assi Ghat...
   Ganga river originates from Gangotri in the north of India where it is named Bhagirathi after King Bhagirath who is 
   known for bringing Ganga down on earth by worshipping and Ganga meets sea at Gangasagar near Kolkata in West Bengal. 
   During this journey, it purifies millions of people who take bath in its holy water. Ganga flows through Varanasi as 
   well and there are 84 ghats along side. People do take this wonderful opportunity to take bath in the holy water and 
   purify them.  It offers a amazing view of the Ganga ji and one must visit this place not for the spiritual 
   significance but for the quaint aspect of Banaras.

<b><u><mark>MUMBAI</mark></u></i></em></b><br><br>
<i><b>good trip.....Hotel rents are available at wide range...Different life style and different type of people.
Train transportation is best way to connect many areas. People can live there as per their income. 
City is best business people...Mumbai the city is an experience everyone should endure. Exhausted after the flight the 
cab ride was "interesting". The cabbie drove us about 2-miles from the airport and wanted more money, saying he needed 
gas money!! Fortunately I was with a friend that grew up there that suggested he drive on before we have an issue.
The smells, sights and sounds were amazing, Nothing like I have ever experienced growing up in the states. I truly feel 
the majority of our troubled teens should be made to lived there for at least 30-days to show them how fortunate they are.
I being the more adventurous type had a good time, but again I was with a local who gave me the grade-A tour. We visited 
many shops, museums and islands dedicated to one god or the other...you can have the best night life with the best pubs, 
discos in India, you can chill out a Juhu beach with family, friends and of course no one can dare to forget Marine Drive
which is the heart of the city's travel guide. If you been to Mumbai and missed to visit Marine Drive and Nariman point 
the "dead end", u have not visited Mumbai.There are various religious places like the Siddhivinayak Temple, 
Mahalaxmi Mandir, Haji Ali and many more...You must also visit the Band Stand at Bandra where the warring neighbours 
"Khans", Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan lives....Gateway of India is nice place to be, from there you can take 
Feri (Boat) to visit Elephanta caves through the Arabian sea route and can have the ultimate view of 
"Taj Mahal Palace" enroute....Mumbai is also the shopping paradise for both brand lovers and street buyres. The person
enjoying shopping will have the best time in Mumbai....Bombay was a good experience and I did enjoy most of it. The 
extreme poverty is a bit depressing though, and I have a ne appreciation for many things...Atmosphere of Goa is quite 
Impressive...there are many hotels and resturants at reasonable cost...a long trip to different beaches..
